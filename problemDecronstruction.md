## What is trying to be solved

An virtual image gallery is something that is used in some cases to promote or bring forward to broather audiences the art or crafts of one or more individuals, in an easy way to access through the internet, even being able to form communities withing the website for people to share crafts and arts, be it from themselves or someone they admire, this is part of the problem that wants to be solved with the creation of this webpage, a place for this humble developer to share images, art, and even videos of their creation or archive, as a way of sharing with the world their accomplishments, throught the implementation of apis to bring this media to the view on a single place

## Requirements
